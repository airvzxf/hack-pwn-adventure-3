# PwnAdventure3 -> Hack

This video game was created to test the hackers. I'm trying to solve it applying the technic "Man In The Middle Attack". I took some ideas and resources from LiveOverflow/PwnAdventure3 (https://github.com/LiveOverflow/PwnAdventure3) but I am doing with my thoughts and resources.

The interesting thing of my project is that I'm doing a transparent proxy in my Linux, avoiding the connection to other computers which fungi as a proxy. I did this with `Vagrant` because it creates its network with a specific public IP `192.168.100.215` and I can to connect to it. Also, I replicate the python code provided by LiveOverflow and run inside this Virtual Machine. Awesome!
